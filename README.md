# Assignment008
This week I will be demonstrating my ability to create basic layouts using the Bootstrap grid. This assignment is very similar to what I did last week, except I will be using the Bootstrap grid. I will take a set of starter files and, by only editing the HTML file, I will format the page so that it creates a 3 column layout with a header and footer.
